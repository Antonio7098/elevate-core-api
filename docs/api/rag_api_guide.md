# RAG API Integration Guide

This guide provides detailed instructions for interacting with the new RAG-powered AI endpoints in the Elevate Core API. These endpoints enable the creation of structured learning materials and facilitate contextual conversations.

**Authentication**: All endpoints described below require authentication. Requests must include an `Authorization` header with a valid JWT Bearer token:
`Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_JWT_TOKEN>`

## 1. Learning Blueprint Creation

This is the first step in any RAG-based content generation workflow. A client sends raw text, and the API deconstructs it into a structured `LearningBlueprint`, which serves as the foundation for generating other materials.

### `POST /api/ai-rag/learning-blueprints`

-   **Purpose**: Creates a new `LearningBlueprint` by deconstructing source text via the internal AI service.
-   **Request Body**: `CreateLearningBlueprintDto`

    ```json
    {
      "sourceText": "The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell. It generates most of the cell's supply of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), used as a source of chemical energy.",
      "folderId": 123
    }
    ```
    -   `sourceText` (string, required): The raw text content to be deconstructed.
    -   `folderId` (number, optional): The ID of the folder where the resulting blueprint should be stored.

-   **Success Response**: `201 Created`
    -   Returns a `LearningBlueprintResponseDto` object.

    ```json
    {
      "id": 1,
      "userId": 1,
      "sourceText": "The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell...",
      "blueprintJson": {
        "topic": "Cellular Biology",
        "key_concepts": [
          { "concept": "Mitochondria", "definition": "The powerhouse of the cell." },
          { "concept": "ATP", "definition": "A source of chemical energy." }
        ]
      },
      "folderId": 123,
      "createdAt": "2025-06-24T10:00:00.000Z",
      "updatedAt": "2025-06-24T10:00:00.000Z"
    }
    ```

-   **Error Responses**:
    -   `400 Bad Request`: Validation error (e.g., `sourceText` is missing or empty).
    -   `401 Unauthorized`: Invalid or missing authentication token.
    -   `502 Bad Gateway`: The internal AI service failed to process the request.

## 2. Generating Materials from a Blueprint

Once a `LearningBlueprint` is created, you can use its ID to generate specific learning materials like question sets or notes.

### `POST /api/ai-rag/learning-blueprints/:blueprintId/question-sets`

-   **Purpose**: Generates a new `QuestionSet` based on the content of a specific `LearningBlueprint`.
-   **Request Body**: `GenerateQuestionsFromBlueprintDto`

    ```json
    {
      "name": "Mitochondria Quiz",
      "folderId": 123,
      "questionOptions": {
        "scope": "KeyConcepts",
        "tone": "Formal"
      }
    }
    ```
    -   `name` (string, required): The title for the new `QuestionSet`.
    -   `folderId` (number, optional): The ID of the folder to store the new question set in. If omitted, it may be placed in a default location.
    -   `questionOptions` (object, optional): Additional parameters to guide the AI's question generation process.

-   **Success Response**: `200 OK`
    -   Returns the newly created `QuestionSet` object with associated questions.

-   **Error Responses**:
    -   `400 Bad Request`: Validation error (e.g., `name` is missing).
    -   `401 Unauthorized`: Invalid or missing authentication token.
    -   `404 Not Found`: The specified `blueprintId` does not exist or the user does not have access to it.
    -   `502 Bad Gateway`: The internal AI service failed to generate questions.

### `POST /api/ai-rag/learning-blueprints/:blueprintId/notes`

-   **Purpose**: Generates a new `Note` based on the content of a specific `LearningBlueprint`.
-   **Request Body**: `GenerateNoteFromBlueprintDto`

    ```json
    {
      "name": "Summary of Mitochondria",
      "folderId": 123
    }
    ```
    -   `name` (string, required): The title for the new `Note`.
    -   `folderId` (number, optional): The ID of the folder to store the new note in.

-   **Success Response**: `200 OK`
    -   Returns the newly created `Note` object.

-   **Error Responses**:
    -   `400 Bad Request`: Validation error (e.g., `name` is missing).
    -   `401 Unauthorized`: Invalid or missing authentication token.
    -   `404 Not Found`: The specified `blueprintId` does not exist or the user does not have access to it.
    -   `502 Bad Gateway`: The internal AI service failed to generate the note.

## 3. Conversational Chat

The chat endpoint provides a unified interface for conversational interaction, with the ability to reference specific learning materials for context.

### `POST /api/ai-rag/chat/message`

-   **Purpose**: Sends a message to the AI assistant and receives a response. The conversation can be contextualized by referencing a `LearningBlueprint`, `QuestionSet`, `Folder`, or other items.
-   **Request Body**: `ChatMessageDto`

    *Example 1: General question*
    ```json
    {
      "messageContent": "What is the capital of Spain?"
    }
    ```

    *Example 2: Question contextualized to a Learning Blueprint*
    ```json
    {
      "messageContent": "Explain this in simpler terms.",
      "context": {
        "blueprintId": 1
      }
    }
    ```
    -   `messageContent` (string, required): The user's message.
    -   `context` (object, optional): An object specifying the context for the conversation.
        -   `blueprintId` (number): ID of a `LearningBlueprint`.
        -   `questionSetId` (number): ID of a `QuestionSet`.
        -   `folderId` (number): ID of a `Folder`.

-   **Success Response**: `200 OK`
    -   Returns a chat response object.

    ```json
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "The capital of Spain is Madrid."
    }
    ```

-   **Error Responses**:
    -   `400 Bad Request`: Validation error (e.g., `messageContent` is missing).
    -   `401 Unauthorized`: Invalid or missing authentication token.
    -   `404 Not Found`: A resource specified in the `context` (e.g., `blueprintId`) does not exist or the user does not have access to it.
    -   `502 Bad Gateway`: The internal AI service failed to process the chat message.
