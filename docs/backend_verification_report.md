# Elevate Core API - Backend Verification Report

**Date:** 2025-06-02
**Objective:** Verify the stability, correctness, and test coverage of key backend features (Spaced Repetition, Today's Tasks, AI Orchestration) to ensure readiness for frontend integration documentation.

**1. Summary of Features Verified:**

*   **Spaced Repetition System (`spacedRepetition.service.ts`):** Core logic for processing question set reviews, updating mastery scores (U-U-E and total), spaced repetition parameters (`nextReviewAt`, `interval`), and history for both `QuestionSet` and parent `Folder` models.
*   **Today's Tasks Generation (`todaysTasks.service.ts`):** "Global U-U-E Pass Progression" algorithm for selecting "Critical," "Core," and "Plus" questions based on user's study time, due dates, and U-U-E stages.
*   **AI Orchestration (`ai.controller.ts`, `aiService.ts`):** Endpoints for question generation, AI chat, and answer evaluation. Secure communication with Python AI service using an API key. Handling of enhanced question attributes (`totalMarksAvailable`, `markingCriteria`).
*   **Prisma Schema & Client:** Alignment of the Prisma schema with current feature requirements and regeneration of the Prisma client.
*   **API Endpoints:** Consistency of request/response structures for key frontend-facing endpoints.
*   **Integration Tests:** Execution of the backend integration test suite.

**2. Detailed Findings:**

**2.1. Spaced Repetition Service (`spacedRepetition.service.ts`)**
*   **`processQuestionSetReview` Function:**
    *   **Logic:** Correctly creates `UserStudySession` and `UserQuestionAnswer` records. Accurately calculates `QuestionSet`-level U-U-E scores (Understand, Use, Explore) by averaging the latest scores for questions within each category from the current review session. Updates `QuestionSet.currentTotalMasteryScore`, spaced repetition data (`nextReviewAt`, `currentIntervalDays`, `lastReviewedAt`), and appends to `masteryHistory`. Updates parent `Folder` mastery (`currentMasteryScore`) and `masteryHistory`.
    *   **Use of `Question.currentMasteryScore`:** The service uses `question.currentMasteryScore` (from the `Question` model) when calculating U-U-E scores for questions *not* included in the current review session's outcomes. The Prisma schema confirms `currentMasteryScore` exists on the `Question` model. The mechanism for updating this field for individual user progress versus a general question attribute needs to be clear.
*   **`getUserProgressSummary` Function:** Provides a good structure for dashboard/stats data.

**2.2. Today's Tasks Generation (`todaysTasks.service.ts`)**
*   **`generateTodaysTasksForUser` Function:**
    *   **Algorithm:** Implements the "Global U-U-E Pass Progression" algorithm.
    *   **Question Selection:** Correctly categorizes due `QuestionSet`s into "critical" and "regular". Selects "Critical," "Core," and "Plus" questions based on user's daily study time, U-U-E stages, and due status.
    *   **Helper Functions:** `determineTargetUUEStage` is robust. `getPrioritizedQuestionsFromSet` fetches user-specific recent answers and prioritizes new and incorrectly answered questions.
    *   **Prioritization TODO:** The detailed prioritization logic within `getPrioritizedQuestionsFromSet` is marked as a `TODO` and does not yet incorporate all desired factors (e.g., `Question.difficultyScore`, nuanced question age/staleness).

**2.3. AI Orchestration (`ai.controller.ts` and `services/aiService.ts`)**
*   **Endpoints:**
    *   `/generate-questions`: Correctly handles `sourceText`, `folderId`, `title`, `numQuestions`. Saves AI-generated question attributes (`totalMarksAvailable`, `markingCriteria`).
    *   `/evaluate-answer`: Handles `questionId`, `userAnswer`.
    *   `/chat`: Handles `message`, `conversation` history, and `context` (including `questionSetId` or `folderId`).
*   **AI Service Communication (`aiService.ts`):**
    *   Secure communication with the Python AI service is confirmed. An Axios client is configured with an `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>` header, where the API key is sourced from the `AI_SERVICE_API_KEY` environment variable.
*   **Error Handling & Fallback:** Robust error handling and fallback simulation logic are present in the AI controller.

**2.4. Prisma Schema & Client (`schema.prisma`)**
*   **Schema Alignment:**
    *   `Folder`: Contains `currentMasteryScore` and `masteryHistory`.
    *   `QuestionSet`: Contains all necessary SR V2 fields (`currentUUESetStage`, `currentTotalMasteryScore`, `understandScore`, `useScore`, `exploreScore`, `nextReviewAt`, `currentIntervalDays`, `masteryHistory`, `currentForgottenPercentage`, etc.). The UUE score fields store average scores for the set.
    *   `Question`: Contains `uueFocus`, `totalMarksAvailable` (mapped to `marksAvailable`), `markingCriteria`.
    *   `UserStudySession` & `UserQuestionAnswer`: Models are structured correctly to link user review sessions and individual answers, including `scoreAchieved` and `uueFocusTested`.
*   **Discrepancy with Memory `bc714564-7447-484e-910b-bdfc27a9e583`:**
    *   The `Question` model in `schema.prisma` **still includes** `currentMasteryScore`, `difficultyScore`, and `conceptTags`. This contradicts Memory `bc714564-7447-484e-910b-bdfc27a9e583`, which stated these fields were removed or that `currentMasteryScore` was moved to a `UserQuestionProgress` model (which does not exist in the current schema).
    *   This implies either the memory is outdated regarding the final schema state, or the refactor mentioned was not fully completed in the schema. The services currently utilize `Question.currentMasteryScore`.
*   **Prisma Client:** Successfully regenerated (`npx prisma generate`) and is in sync with the schema.

**2.5. API Endpoints Review**
*   Key frontend-facing API endpoints (Authentication, Dashboard/Stats, Today's Tasks, Review Submission, Folder CRUD, QuestionSet CRUD, Question Retrieval, AI Endpoints) generally have consistent request/response structures that align with the service logic and schema.
*   The data provided by these endpoints appears sufficient for frontend consumption.

**2.6. Integration Test Results**
*   **Overall:** 149 passed, 12 failed, 161 total.
*   **Failed Suites/Tests:**
    *   **`Spaced Repetition Service Tests` (4 failures):**
        *   Tests for `processQuestionSetReview` are failing.
        *   Common Warning: `QuestionSet with ID X has no questions. Skipping UUE calculation.` This indicates an issue with test data setup where `QuestionSet`s are not being populated with their associated `Question`s before the service logic attempts to access them for UUE calculations.
    *   **`Evaluation Routes Tests` (4 failures):**
        *   Tests for `POST /api/evaluate/evaluate-answer` are failing.
        *   Common Warning: Also shows `QuestionSet with ID X has no questions. Skipping UUE calculation.` This is likely because the evaluation controller calls `processQuestionSetReview`, and the `QuestionSet` data used in these tests is similarly missing its `questions` relation.
    *   **`AI Controller Tests` (4 failures):**
        *   Tests for `generateQuestionsFromSource` and `chatWithAI` are failing.
        *   Errors like `expect(aiService.isAvailable).toHaveBeenCalled()` receiving 0 calls. This suggests a mocking issue. The `ai.controller.ts` creates its own instance of `AIService`. The tests in `src/controllers/__tests__/ai.controller.test.ts` mock the `aiService` module, but the controller's internal instance might not be using the mocked version correctly, especially for the `isAvailable` async getter.

**3. Overall Assessment & Readiness:**

*   The core logic for spaced repetition, today's tasks, and AI orchestration is largely in place and aligns with the intended U-U-E framework and SRv2 design.
*   The Prisma schema supports these features, though a discrepancy regarding certain fields on the `Question` model (compared to past memories) has been noted.
*   API endpoints are generally consistent.
*   **The backend is partially verified.** While core logic seems sound, the 12 failing integration tests, particularly those related to `spacedRepetition.service.ts` and `evaluation.controller.ts` (due to data setup) and `ai.controller.ts` (due to mocking), indicate areas that need attention before the backend can be considered fully stable and verified.

**4. Key Outstanding Issues & Points of Attention:**

1.  **Failing Integration Tests (12 tests):**
    *   **`Spaced Repetition Service` & `Evaluation Routes` tests:** Test data setup needs to ensure `QuestionSet` objects are correctly populated with their `questions` array when being used in tests that involve `processQuestionSetReview`.
    *   **`AI Controller` tests:** The mocking strategy for `AIService` (especially the `isAvailable` getter) within `ai.controller.test.ts` needs to be revised to ensure the controller uses the mocked instance.
2.  **`Question` Model Fields Discrepancy:** Clarify the role and update mechanism for `Question.currentMasteryScore`, `Question.difficultyScore`, and `Question.conceptTags`. Ensure their presence and usage align with the intended data model for user-specific vs. general question attributes. This is important for the accuracy of SR and task generation.
3.  **`todaysTasks.service.ts` Prioritization:** The `TODO` for enhancing question prioritization logic in `getPrioritizedQuestionsFromSet` should be addressed in the future to allow for more nuanced question selection (e.g., using `difficultyScore`).

**Recommendation:**
While significant progress has been made and core features are implemented, it is recommended to address the failing integration tests to ensure full reliability. Once the tests are passing and the `Question` model field discrepancy is clarified, the backend will be in a stronger position for generating comprehensive frontend integration documentation.
