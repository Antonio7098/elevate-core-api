## Description
Non-strict TypeScript allows null/any bugs to reach production.

## Triggers / Indicators
Runtime TypeErrors; ad hoc type assertions.

## Mitigations
- Preventive: Enable strict options; add CI rules
- Detective: Type coverage tracking
- Corrective: Refactor problematic areas

## Residual Risk
Low after full strict adoption.
