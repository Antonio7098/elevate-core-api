## Description
Sensitive headers and bodies logged to console can leak PII and credentials.

## Triggers / Indicators
Authorization headers present in logs; customer data visible in logs.

## Mitigations
- Preventive: Redaction and structured logging; avoid body logging by default
- Detective: Log scanning rules; CI checks for forbidden strings
- Corrective: Rotate secrets; purge logs; incident response

## Residual Risk
Low once redaction and policies are enforced.
