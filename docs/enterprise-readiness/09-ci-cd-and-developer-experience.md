# CI/CD & Developer Experience

## Pipeline
- Not captured in repo; scripts for dev/test present

## Gates
- No documented gates for lint, coverage, SAST, secret scan

## DevEx
- Nodemon for dev; ts-node start; no `make`/task runner documented

## Findings
- ER-CICD-001: Missing documented CI pipeline with quality/security gates

## Recommendations
- Add CI with lint, test, coverage, SAST, secret scanning, SBOM generation; branch protections and CODEOWNERS
