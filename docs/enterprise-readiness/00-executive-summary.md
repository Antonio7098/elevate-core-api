# Executive Summary

## Overall Posture
Early-stage with strong functional coverage. Key gaps in PII-safe logging, TypeScript strictness, API documentation completeness, and Swagger coverage beyond RAG endpoints.

Preliminary readiness score: 2.5 / 5 (Basic â†’ Adequate)

## Top Risks (initial)
- ER-SEC-001: PII exposure via request logging at top-level and in auth middleware
- ER-CODE-002: TypeScript strict mode disabled (tsconfig `strict: false`)
- ER-API-001: OpenAPI coverage limited to ai-rag; most Express routes undocumented

## Key Decisions (draft)
- ADR-001: Centralize logging via Winston with redaction and correlation IDs
- ADR-002: Enable TypeScript strict mode with staged remediation
- ADR-003: Consolidate API documentation (Nest generator for RAG + manual OpenAPI for Express routes)

## Next 30/60/90 Days
- 30d: Logging hardening, strict mode plan, generate baseline OpenAPI spec for all routes
- 60d: Security headers, rate limiting, dependency audit SLO and SBOM integration
- 90d: Performance profiling, caching policy formalization, reliability runbooks
