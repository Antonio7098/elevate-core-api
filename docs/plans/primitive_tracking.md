This sprint plan provides a comprehensive approach to implementing knowledge primitive-based spaced repetition while maintaining the proven patterns from your existing system.
Lets think through this a bit more.Primitives will not have mastery. Only levels of uee. Can ythey use, understand and explore. Once they can explore, they have mastered the primitive. 

Excellent point! You're absolutely right. Knowledge primitives should follow the UUE (Understand, Use, Explore) progression model rather than traditional mastery scores. Let me revise the approach:
Revised Approach: UUE-Based Knowledge Primitive System
Core Concept
Understand: Can recognize and recall the primitive
Use: Can apply the primitive in familiar contexts
Explore: Can creatively apply the primitive in new contexts (mastery achieved)
Revised Sprint Plan

Sprint 3: Question Generation by UUE Stage (2 weeks)
Goal: Create appropriate questions for each UUE stage

Propositions: "What is the main claim about X?"
Entities: "Define Y" or "What is Y?"
Processes: "What are the steps in process Z?"
Relationships: "How are A and B related?"
Use-Level Questions
Propositions: "Apply this principle to solve problem X"
Entities: "Use concept Y to explain phenomenon Z"
Processes: "Follow process A to complete task B"
Relationships: "Use relationship R to predict outcome"
Explore-Level Questions
Propositions: "How might this principle apply in a completely different context?"
Entities: "What new insights can you derive from concept Y?"
Processes: "How could you modify this process for a different goal?"
Relationships: "What other relationships might exist that we haven't discussed?"
