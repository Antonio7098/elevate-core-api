This is a significant and powerful conceptual shift! You're proposing to fundamentally separate achieving mastery at a UEE level from maintaining retention over time. This is a more nuanced and potentially more effective approach.

You're essentially saying:

Mastery (UEE Progression) is about demonstrating a specific cognitive ability (Understand, Use, Explore) for a primitive, measured by performance on specific types and quantities of questions.

Retention (Spaced Repetition) is about ensuring that achieved mastery doesn't decay over time, managed by a forgetting curve and review intervals.

This leads to a much cleaner model. Let's redefine it:

Redefining Mastery & The Role of Spaced Repetition
Core Principle: Mastery is Achieved by Demonstrated Skill; Retention is Maintained by Spaced Review.
1. Redefined UEE Level Mastery (Achieving Mastery)
A primitive P is considered "mastered" at a specific UEE_Level (e.g., "Understand", "Use", "Explore") when the user demonstrates sufficient proficiency on relevant questions, independent of the time intervals.

For a primitive P to master a UEE_Level and advance to the next:

a. Understand Mastery (Basic Definitions & Processes):

Criteria: The user must achieve 100% correctness on a single, initial "Understand"-level question related to primitive P. (This assumes an initial "What is X?" or "Describe Y's basic function" type question).

Action: Upon this single successful demonstration, primitive P is immediately considered "Mastered" at the "Understand" level. It then immediately becomes eligible to begin "Use" level challenges.

b. Use Mastery (Applying in Context):

Criteria: The user must achieve an average of 90%+ correctness across a minimum of N_Use distinct "Use"-level questions related to primitive P. These questions must have been answered correctly at least once.

(N_Use is a configurable integer, e.g., 2 or 3, representing different facets of "Use").

Action: Once these N_Use distinct questions are passed (with the 90%+ average), primitive P is immediately considered "Mastered" at the "Use" level. It then immediately becomes eligible to begin "Explore" level challenges.

c. Explore Mastery (Open-ended, Critical Evaluation, Analysis):

Criteria: The user must achieve an average of 90%+ correctness across a minimum of N_Explore distinct "Explore"-level questions related to primitive P. These questions must have been answered correctly at least once.

(N_Explore is a configurable integer, e.g., 1 or 2, representing different critical approaches).

Action: Once these N_Explore distinct questions are passed (with the 90%+ average), primitive P is considered fully "Mastered" for this source.

2. The Role of Forgetting Curve & Spaced Repetition (Maintaining Mastery)
Once a primitive P has achieved mastery at its current_uee_level (and thus advanced to that level), the Spaced Repetition System (SRS) takes over to ensure that mastery is retained over time.

a. Forgetting Curve Calculation:

due_date: This will be dynamically calculated using a forgetting curve algorithm (e.g., a variant of SM-2, or a more sophisticated adaptive algorithm).

Factors: The due_date will depend on:

last_reviewed_date.

The primitive's ease_factor (how easily it's recalled).

Its current_interval (which dictates the next review period).

Its current_uee_level (higher levels might have higher initial ease or longer intervals).

The 1d, 2d, 3d, 30d now represents the progression of these intervals if reviews are successful, aiming to space out retention reviews.

b. Review Schedule:

Primitives will be "due" for review when their due_date arrives.

The question presented for review will be at the primitive's highest achieved UEE level (e.g., if "Mastered Use," the review question will be a "Use" level question).

c. Performance on Review (Adjusting Retention):

Correct Answer: If the review question is answered correctly, the ease_factor might increase slightly, and the current_interval is extended (e.g., from 3d to 30d, or 30d to 90d), pushing the due_date further out. consecutive_failures_on_review resets.

Incorrect Answer (Retention Lapse):

The ease_factor might decrease.

The current_interval is shortened (e.g., from 30d back to 3d or even 1d), bringing the due_date sooner.

consecutive_failures_on_review increments.

Demotion Trigger: If consecutive_failures_on_review reaches a predefined threshold (e.g., 2-3 consecutive failures on retention reviews for the same primitive), it indicates a significant lapse in mastery.

Action: The primitive's current_uee_level demotes (e.g., from "Use" back to "Understand"). Its distinct_questions_passed_at_level counts for the higher level might be reset, and its ease_factor and current_interval are reset to initial values to re-establish mastery from a lower cognitive level.

This refined model provides a clear, logical separation between demonstrating the ability to Understand, Use, or Explore (Mastery) and ensuring that ability persists over time (Retention). It ensures that the SRS serves its true purpose: efficient, long-term knowledge retention.
