# Spaced Repetition System v3: Primitive-Centric Tracking

## 1. Overview & Goal

The goal of this new system is to shift the focus of spaced repetition from the `QuestionSet` level to the more granular `KnowledgePrimitive` level. This will allow for a more precise and adaptive learning experience, tracking a user's understanding of individual concepts, facts, and processes.

This document outlines the proposed data model changes, algorithm logic, and API endpoints required to implement this new system.

## 2. Core Concepts

*   **Knowledge Primitive (Locus):** The atomic unit of knowledge to be tracked. This can be a single fact, a definition, a step in a process, or a relationship between concepts.
*   **Mastery Criteria:** A set of specific, testable statements that define what it means to master a primitive. A primitive is not considered "mastered" until all its criteria are met.
*   **UEE Ladder (Understand, Use, Explore):** Each primitive and its associated criteria will be categorized into one of these three levels of understanding. The user progresses up the ladder as they demonstrate deeper mastery.
*   **Criterion Mastery:** A single criterion is met when the user masters at least one question linked to it.
*   **Primitive Mastery:** A primitive is mastered when all its associated Mastery Criteria are met.

## 3. From Blueprint JSON to Database Primitives

### Previous System: `QuestionSet`-Based SR

Previously, knowledge primitives were conceptual entities generated by the AI API and stored within a blueprint JSON file. The spaced repetition (SR) system operated on `QuestionSets`, which were derived from this blueprint. This approach lacked the granularity to track a user's mastery of individual concepts.

### New System: Primitive-Centric SR

The new system elevates `KnowledgePrimitives` to be first-class, trackable units within the core database. SR will now monitor and adapt to a user's progress on each specific primitive, rather than on a broad `QuestionSet`. This allows for a much more precise and personalized learning journey. The AI API's role will evolve to deconstruct source material directly into the new database models (`KnowledgePrimitive`, `MasteryCriterion`), making them persistent, core components of the application.

## 4. Proposed Data Model Changes (Prisma Schema)

We will need to introduce new models and update existing ones to support this new system.

```prisma
// In schema.prisma

model KnowledgePrimitive {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  userId    Int      // Every primitive must belong to a user
  user      User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  // ... other fields to define the primitive itself
  
  // --- Spaced Repetition Fields ---
  masteryCriteria MasteryCriterion[]
  isTracking      Boolean  @default(true)
  
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
}

model MasteryCriterion {
  id          Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  userId      Int
  user        User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  primitiveId Int
  primitive   KnowledgePrimitive @relation(fields: [primitiveId], references: [id])
  
  description String // e.g., "Can state the definition of Photosynthesis"
  ueeLevel    String   // "Understand", "Use", or "Explore"
  
  questions   Question[] // Questions that test this criterion
  
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
}

// New model to track a user's progress on a specific primitive
model UserPrimitiveProgress {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  userId    Int
  user      User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  
  primitiveId Int
  primitive   KnowledgePrimitive @relation(fields: [primitiveId], references: [id])
  
  currentUeeLevel String   @default("Understand")
  nextReviewAt    DateTime?
  lastReviewedAt  DateTime?
  
  // Other SR fields like interval, ease factor, etc.

  // The question that was answered to level up to the current UEE level
  answeredQuestionId Int?
  answeredQuestion   Question? @relation(fields: [answeredQuestionId], references: [id])
  
  @@unique([userId, primitiveId])
}

// New model to track a user's mastery of a specific criterion
model UserCriterionMastery {
  id              Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  userId          Int
  user            User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  criterionId     Int
  criterion       MasteryCriterion @relation(fields: [criterionId], references: [id])
  isMastered      Boolean  @default(false)
  masteredAt      DateTime?
  masteringQuestionId Int? // The question that led to mastery of this criterion
  masteringQuestion Question? @relation(fields: [masteringQuestionId], references: [id])

  @@unique([userId, criterionId])
}


// Update to the Question model
model Question {
  // ... existing fields
  
  masteryCriterionIds Int[]?
  masteryCriterion   MasteryCriterion @relation(fields: [masteryCriterionId], references: [id])
}
```

## 5. Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Database Schema Implementation

The first step is to modify the Prisma schema (`schema.prisma`) to introduce the new models required for primitive-centric tracking.

1.  **Create `KnowledgePrimitive` Model:** This model will represent the atomic unit of knowledge.
2.  **Create `MasteryCriterion` Model:** This will define the requirements for mastering a `KnowledgePrimitive`, categorized by the "Understand, Use, Explore" (UEE) ladder.
3.  **Create `UserPrimitiveProgress` Model:** This new table will track each user's spaced repetition data (e.g., `nextReviewAt`, `currentUeeLevel`) for each `KnowledgePrimitive`.
4.  **Create `UserCriterionMastery` Model:** This new table will track a user's mastery of individual criteria.
5.  **Update `Question` Model:** Add a relation from the `Question` model to the `MasteryCriterion` model to link each question to a specific criterion it tests.

### Phase 2: Algorithm and Service Layer Refactoring

Next, the backend services and algorithms will be updated to use the new data models. This involves defining the logic for review selection, the daily task generation, spaced repetition scheduling, and UEE progression.

#### **1. The "Today's Tasks" Algorithm**
This algorithm generates a prioritized daily task list by filling three buckets: **Critical**, **Core**, and **Plus**. It relies on querying related models, including `userQuestionAnswer`, to determine priority without needing to modify the `UserPrimitiveProgress` schema. The selection pool for primitives must only include those owned by the current user. Additionally, all queries must filter for primitives where `KnowledgePrimitive.isTracking` is `true`.

*   **Bucket 1: Critical Tasks**
    *   **Pool:** Union of (A) Overdue primitives (`nextReviewAt < TODAY`) and (B) Repeatedly Failed primitives (`consecutiveFailures >= 2`).
    *   **Sorting:**
        1.  **Primary:** Days overdue (descending).
        2.  **Secondary:** UEE Level (ascending: "Understand" > "Use" > "Explore").

*   **Bucket 2: Core Tasks**
    *   **Pool:** Union of (A) Primitives due today, (B) Primitives due tomorrow, and (C) New primitives never reviewed.
    *   **Sorting:**
        1.  **Primary:** Score of the last attempt (ascending). This is determined by finding the most recent `userQuestionAnswer` linked to the primitive and calculating a score percentage (`marks / maxMarks`). This prioritizes items the user struggled with most. New primitives are treated as having a 100% score.
        2.  **Secondary:** UEE Level (ascending).

*   **Bucket 3: Plus Tasks (Stretch Goals)**
    *   **Pool:** Union of (A) UEE Progression Previews (questions from the next UEE level for primitives answered correctly today) and (B) Long-Term Reinforcement (mastered primitives not seen in >90 days).
    *   **Sorting:**
        1.  **Primary:** UEE Level (ascending).
        2.  **Secondary:** `lastReviewedAt` date (ascending, oldest first).

*   **Final Assembly:** A target task count (e.g., 20) is filled by taking all sorted Critical tasks, then filling the rest of the space with sorted Core tasks, and finally with sorted Plus tasks.

#### **2. Spaced Repetition Scheduling Algorithm (Fixed-Interval v3)**
This algorithm uses a fixed ladder of intervals. A user's performance on a given day determines whether they advance, retreat, or maintain their position.

*   **Core Components:**
    *   **Interval Ladder:** A predefined array, e.g., `INTERVALS = [1, 3, 7, 21]` (in days).
    *   **Tracking Model (`UserPrimitiveProgress`):** A new field `currentIntervalStep` (Integer) will be added to track the user's position on the ladder.

*   **Review Logic:**
    *   **Case 1: Correct on First Attempt:**
        *   **Action:** Advance one step up the interval ladder.
        *   **Implementation:** Increment `currentIntervalStep` and set `nextReviewAt` to `now() + INTERVALS[new_step]`.
    *   **Case 2: Incorrect Answer:**
        *   **Action:** Move back one step on the interval ladder and schedule the next review for tomorrow.
        *   **Implementation:** Decrement `currentIntervalStep` (floor at 0) and set `nextReviewAt` to `now() + 1 day`.
    *   **Case 3: Same-Day Correction:**
        *   **Action:** Negate the penalty. The interval step is maintained, and the review clock is reset.
        *   **Implementation:** If a user corrects a mistake on the same day, the `currentIntervalStep` is restored to its pre-session value, and `nextReviewAt` is set to `now() + INTERVALS[current_step]`.

#### **3. UEE Ladder Progression Logic**
*   A user progresses from "Understand" to "Use" for a primitive only after they have met all "Understand"-level `MasteryCriteria` for that primitive.
*   Meeting a criterion requires correctly answering at least one question associated with it.
*   When a user meets the final criterion for a given UEE level, the `UserPrimitiveProgress` record is updated. The `currentUeeLevel` is advanced, and the `answeredQuestionId` is set to the ID of the question that triggered the level-up.
*   A new model, `UserCriterionMastery`, will be needed to track this. When a user levels up a primitive's UEE state, the SR state (`currentIntervalStep`, `nextReviewAt`) for that primitive will be reset to start the new level fresh.

### Phase 3: API and AI Integration

Finally, the API endpoints and the role of the AI API will be adjusted.

1.  **API Endpoint Changes:**
    *   **New Endpoints:** Create new endpoints (`POST /api/primitives/review`, `GET /api/primitives/due`, `POST /api/primitives/:id/tracking`) to handle the new review workflow.
    *   **Deprecation:** The existing `QuestionSet`-based review endpoints (`/api/reviews/...`) will be marked for deprecation and eventually phased out.
2.  **Evolve AI API's Role:**
    *   The AI API's function will be updated. Instead of only generating a blueprint JSON, it will now be responsible for deconstructing source material into the new database models: `KnowledgePrimitive` and their associated `MasteryCriterion`. This makes the primitives a persistent and integral part of the core application.

## 6. Changes Necessary in the Existing Codebase

This section will detail the specific modifications required across the application to transition from `QuestionSet`-based spaced repetition to the new `KnowledgePrimitive`-centric system.

*   **6.1 Database Schema (`src/db/prisma/schema.prisma`)**
    *   **New Models:**
        *   `KnowledgePrimitive`: `id`, `userId`, `title`, `content`, `isTracking`, `masteryCriteria`, `progress`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`.
        *   `MasteryCriterion`: `id`, `userId`, `primitiveId`, `description`, `ueeLevel`, `questions`, `mastery`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`.
        *   `UserPrimitiveProgress`: `id`, `userId`, `primitiveId`, `currentUeeLevel`, `nextReviewAt`, `lastReviewedAt`, `currentIntervalStep`, `consecutiveFailures`, `answeredQuestionId`.
        *   `UserCriterionMastery`: `id`, `userId`, `criterionId`, `isMastered`, `masteredAt`, `masteringQuestionId`.
    *   **Modified Models:**
        *   `Question`: Add `masteryCriterionId` and a relation to `MasteryCriterion`. Remove `uueFocus`.
        *   `QuestionSet`: Remove SR fields: `nextReviewAt`, `lastReviewedAt`, `currentIntervalDays`, `easeFactor`, `lapses`, `trackingMode`, `isTracked`, and all other SR-related metrics. It will now primarily act as a container for questions.
        *   `UserQuestionAnswer`: Make `questionSetId` optional. Add optional relations `primitiveId` and `masteryCriterionId`.
        *   `Note`: Make `questionSetId` optional. Add optional `primitiveId`.
        *   `ScheduledReview`: Make `questionSetId` optional. Add optional `primitiveId`.
    *   **Relationships:**
        *   `KnowledgePrimitive` will have a one-to-many relationship with `MasteryCriterion` and `UserPrimitiveProgress`.
        *   `MasteryCriterion` will have a one-to-many relationship with `Question` and `UserCriterionMastery`.
        *   `User` will have one-to-many relationships with all new models.

*   **6.2 API Endpoints**
    *   **New Endpoints (Primitive-Centric):**
        *   `GET /api/primitives/due`: Fetches a user's daily, prioritized list of primitives for review. Replaces `/api/reviews/today`.
        *   `POST /api/primitives/review`: Submits the outcome of a review session for a primitive. Replaces `POST /api/reviews`.
        *   `POST /api/primitives/:id/tracking`: Toggles the `isTracking` status for a primitive.
        *   `GET /api/primitives`: Lists all primitives for a user.
        *   `GET /api/primitives/:id`: Retrieves detailed information for a single primitive, including its criteria and progress.
    *   **Modified Endpoints:**
        *   `ai-rag.controller` endpoints that generate `QuestionSet` will be updated to generate `KnowledgePrimitive` and `MasteryCriterion` instead.
    *   **Deprecation Strategy:**
        *   The entire `/api/reviews/` route will be deprecated.
        *   A deprecation notice will be added to the API documentation. For a transition period, old endpoints can return a `410 Gone` status with a message pointing to the new API.

*   **6.3 Service Layer Refactoring**
    *   **`todaysTasks.service.ts`:**
        *   Rewrite `getDueSetsForUser` to `getDuePrimitivesForUser`. This will implement the new three-bucket logic (Critical, Core, Plus) by querying `UserPrimitiveProgress`, `UserQuestionAnswer`, and `KnowledgePrimitive`.
    *   **`reviewScheduling.service.ts`:**
        *   This service will be refactored to manage manually scheduled reviews for primitives (`ScheduledReview` model) rather than being the core of the SR system.
    *   **`advancedSpacedRepetition.service.ts`:**
        *   This service will be heavily modified or replaced. Its core logic for calculating review schedules will be moved into a new service that implements the "Fixed-Interval v3" algorithm, updating `UserPrimitiveProgress` based on review outcomes.
    *   **`stats.service.ts`:**
        *   Rewrite `fetchQuestionSetStatsDetails` to `fetchPrimitiveStatsDetails`. All stats calculations will now be based on `UserPrimitiveProgress` and `UserCriterionMastery`.
    *   **`ai-rag.service.ts`:**
        *   Update the service to parse AI-generated content into `KnowledgePrimitive` and `MasteryCriterion` entities, persisting them to the database.
    *   **`dashboard.service.ts`:**
        *   Update to fetch and display statistics based on the new primitive-centric models.

*   **6.4 Controller Layer Updates**
    *   **New Controllers:**
        *   `primitive.controller.ts`: Will handle all CRUD and review-related operations for primitives.
    *   **Modified Controllers:**
        *   `review.controller.ts`: To be deprecated and its functionality moved to `primitive.controller.ts`.
        *   `todaysTasks.controller.ts`: Updated to call the new `getDuePrimitivesForUser` service method.
        *   `stats.controller.ts`: Updated to call the new primitive-centric stats services.
        *   `ai.controller.ts` / `ai-rag.controller.ts`: Updated to trigger the new primitive generation process.
        *   `questionset.controller.ts`: Will now only manage non-SR `QuestionSet` entities.

*   **6.5 Types and DTOs**
    *   **New:** `KnowledgePrimitiveDto`, `MasteryCriterionDto`, `UserPrimitiveProgressDto`, `PrimitiveReviewOutcomeDto`.
    *   **Modified:** `QuestionDto` (add `masteryCriterionId`), `UserQuestionAnswerDto` (add `primitiveId`), `NoteDto` (add `primitiveId`).
    *   **Deprecated:** `DueQuestionSet`, `FrontendReviewSubmission`, `QuestionSetStatsDetails`, and other SR-related `QuestionSet` types.

*   **6.6 Testing Strategy**
    *   **Unit Tests:** New tests for the "Today's Tasks" bucketing logic, the "Fixed-Interval v3" scheduling algorithm, and UEE ladder progression. Existing tests for services like `todaysTasks.service.ts` will be rewritten.
    *   **Integration Tests:** New tests for the `/api/primitives/*` endpoints. Tests for deprecated review endpoints will be removed.
    *   **End-to-End Tests:** A new E2E test scenario for the complete lifecycle of a primitive: creation from a document, appearing in "Today's Tasks", reviewing it, and tracking its progress and mastery over time.

*   **6.7 Data Migration Strategy**
    *   A one-time migration script (`scripts/migrate-sr-data.ts`) will be created.
    *   **Logic:**
        1.  Iterate through each `QuestionSet` that has `isTracked = true`.
        2.  For each such `QuestionSet`, create one `KnowledgePrimitive`.
        3.  For each `Question` in the set, create a corresponding `MasteryCriterion`, linking it to the new primitive.
        4.  Create a `UserPrimitiveProgress` record from the `QuestionSet`'s SR data (`nextReviewAt`, `lastReviewedAt`, etc.).
        5.  Analyze `UserQuestionAnswer` history to populate `UserCriterionMastery` records.
    *   **Rollback:** A database backup must be performed before running the script. The script should be designed to be runnable multiple times on a staging environment for verification.

*   **6.8 Frontend Impact (Brief Mention)**
    *   The frontend will need significant updates. This includes creating new UI components for displaying primitive-based tasks, review interfaces, and progress visualizations. All data fetching logic related to spaced repetition will need to be pointed to the new `/api/primitives/*` endpoints. This is a major change that will require coordinated effort with the frontend team.
