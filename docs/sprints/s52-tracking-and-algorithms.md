# Sprint 52: Blueprint-Centric Overhaul - Phase 3 Tracking & Algorithms

**Signed off** DO NOT PROCEED UNLESS SIGNED OFF BY ANTONIO
**Date Range:** [Start Date] - [End Date]
**Primary Focus:** Core API - Spaced Repetition Algorithms, Mastery Tracking, Daily Task Generation
**Overview:** Implement the new mastery tracking system and spaced repetition algorithms for the blueprint-centric architecture. Replace existing SR services with new criterion-based mastery tracking while maintaining legacy compatibility.

**Key System Updates:**
- **MasteryCriterion-based tracking**: Replace primitive-based tracking with criterion-level mastery
- **Consecutive intervals mastery**: Mastery requires 2 consecutive intervals above threshold (different days)
- **Weighted UUE stage mastery**: Stage mastery calculated from weighted average of criterion mastery percentages
- **Complete primitive mastery**: All UUE stages must be mastered for primitive completion

## II. Database Schema Changes & Migration Strategy

### New Models Required:
```typescript
// UserCriterionMastery - Core tracking model
model UserCriterionMastery {
  id                    Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  userId                Int
  criterionId           String
  masteryScore          Float    // 0.0 - 1.0
  consecutiveIntervals  Int      @default(0)
  lastMasteredDate      DateTime?
  lastAttemptDate       DateTime
  attemptHistory        Json     // Last N attempts for calculation
  
  @@unique([userId, criterionId])
  @@index([userId, lastAttemptDate])
  @@index([criterionId, masteryScore])
}

// SectionMasteryThreshold - User-configurable thresholds
model SectionMasteryThreshold {
  id          Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  userId      Int
  sectionId   String
  threshold   Float  // 0.6, 0.8, 0.95 for SURVEY/PROFICIENT/EXPERT
  
  @@unique([userId, sectionId])
}
```

### Development Strategy:
1. **Phase 1**: Implement new models and services
2. **Phase 2**: Create comprehensive test coverage
3. **Phase 3**: Performance optimization and caching
4. **Phase 4**: Integration with AI API
5. **Phase 5**: User interface and experience enhancements

### Performance Considerations:
- **Indexes**: Critical for userId + lastAttemptDate queries
- **Caching**: Redis cache for frequently accessed mastery scores
- **Batch Processing**: Daily mastery calculations in background jobs

---

## III. AI API Integration Requirements

### Required AI API Updates:
1. **Criterion Mapping**: AI API must map generated primitives to specific mastery criteria
2. **Weighted Question Generation**: Support for criterion importance weights in question selection
3. **UUE Stage Content**: Generate stage-specific content (Understand/Use/Explore)
4. **Contract Updates**: New schemas for criterion-based requests/responses

### New AI API Endpoints Needed:
```typescript
POST /api/v1/primitives/generate-with-criteria
POST /api/v1/questions/criterion-specific
POST /api/v1/content/uue-stage-specific
```

### Integration Points:
- Core API sends blueprint → AI API generates primitives with criteria
- Core API requests questions → AI API returns criterion-mapped questions
- Mastery scores influence AI API question difficulty selection

---

## IV. Error Handling & Edge Cases

### Critical Scenarios:
1. **Incomplete Data**: What if criterion mastery history is missing?
   - Fallback: Use default mastery score (0.0) and rebuild from next attempts
2. **Mixed Data**: Users with both old primitive and new criterion data
   - Strategy: Maintain parallel tracking until migration complete
3. **AI API Failures**: When criterion-specific content generation fails
   - Fallback: Use generic questions with manual criterion mapping
4. **Calculation Failures**: When weighted averages can't be computed
   - Fallback: Use simple average or last-known-good values

### Graceful Degradation:
- System continues functioning with reduced features if components fail
- Clear error messages for users when advanced features unavailable
- Automatic retry mechanisms for transient failures

---

## V. Monitoring & Analytics Framework

### Key Metrics to Track:
1. **System Performance**:
   - Mastery calculation response times
   - Daily task generation latency
   - Database query performance
2. **User Engagement**:
   - Mastery progression rates
   - Task completion percentages
   - User threshold preference distributions
3. **Algorithm Effectiveness**:
   - Retention rates by mastery level
   - Progression speed comparisons (old vs new system)
   - User satisfaction with task difficulty

### Alerting Strategy:
- Performance degradation alerts (>2s response times)
- Data inconsistency alerts (mastery scores outside expected ranges)
- User experience alerts (high task abandonment rates)

---

## VI. Risk Mitigation & Deployment Strategy

### Rollback Plan:
1. **Feature Flags**: Instant rollback to old system if issues arise
2. **Data Preservation**: Keep old tracking data until new system proven stable
3. **User Communication**: Clear messaging about system changes and benefits

### A/B Testing Framework:
- 10% of users on new system initially
- Compare key metrics: engagement, retention, satisfaction
- Gradual rollout based on positive results

### Deployment Phases:
1. **Week 1-2**: Internal testing with development team
2. **Week 3-4**: Beta testing with 50 volunteer users
3. **Week 5-6**: Limited rollout to 10% of user base
4. **Week 7-8**: Full rollout if metrics positive

      if (userMastery) {
        const masteryScore = userMastery.masteryScore;
        const weight = criterion.weight;
        
        totalWeightedScore += masteryScore * weight;
        totalWeight += weight;
        
        if (userMastery.isMastered) {
          masteredCriteria++;
        }
      }
    }
    
    const stageMastery = totalWeight > 0 ? totalWeightedScore / totalWeight : 0;
    const isMastered = stageMastery >= 0.8; // 80% threshold
    
    return {
      stage: uueStage,
      masteryScore: stageMastery,
      isMastered,
      totalCriteria: criteria.length,
      masteredCriteria,
      totalWeight
    };
  }
}
```

### D. Forgetting Curve Integration (Future Enhancement)

#### **Data Collection for Forgetting Curves**
With our new system, we'll collect rich data that enables sophisticated forgetting curve analysis:

```typescript
// Data we'll have for each user-criterion combination:
interface ForgettingCurveData {
  // Review history
  reviewDates: Date[];
  performanceScores: number[];
  timeBetweenReviews: number[];
  
  // Mastery progression
  masteryLevels: string[]; // UNDERSTAND → USE → EXPLORE
  stageTransitionDates: Date[];
  
  // Individual differences
  userLearningStyle: LearningStyle;
  trackingIntensity: TrackingIntensity;
  subjectDifficulty: number;
  
  // Context factors
  studySessionDuration: number;
  timeOfDay: number;
  dayOfWeek: number;
  stressLevel?: number; // If we collect this
}
```

#### **Future Forgetting Curve Algorithm**
```typescript
class AdaptiveForgettingCurve {
  /**
   * Calculate optimal review interval based on forgetting curve data
   * This will be a future enhancement using the data we're collecting now
   */
  calculateOptimalInterval(
    userId: number,
    criterionId: string,
    currentMastery: number
  ): number {
    const forgettingData = this.getForgettingCurveData(userId, criterionId);
    
    // Analyze individual forgetting patterns
    const personalForgettingRate = this.calculatePersonalForgettingRate(forgettingData);
    const masteryRetention = this.calculateMasteryRetention(forgettingData);
    const optimalSpacing = this.calculateOptimalSpacing(forgettingData);
    
    // Combine factors for personalized interval
    return this.combineFactors(
      personalForgettingRate,
      masteryRetention, 
      optimalSpacing,
      currentMastery
    );
  }
  
  /**
   * Calculate personal forgetting rate from historical data
   */
  private calculatePersonalForgettingRate(data: ForgettingCurveData): number {
    // Analyze how quickly this user forgets specific concepts
    // Use machine learning on their review history
    return this.mlModel.predictForgettingRate(data);
  }
}
```

#### **Why Our System Enables This**
1. **Granular tracking**: Every review attempt is recorded with context
2. **Mastery progression**: We track UUE stage transitions over time
3. **Individual differences**: Tracking intensity, learning style, performance patterns
4. **Temporal patterns**: When users study, how long sessions are, etc.
5. **Concept relationships**: How mastery of one criterion affects others

#### **Implementation Phases**
- **Phase 1 (Sprint 52)**: Collect all the data we need
- **Phase 2 (Future)**: Build ML models for forgetting curve prediction
- **Phase 3 (Future)**: Integrate adaptive intervals into SR algorithm

// Future: "Antonio, based on your learning patterns:
// - You retain math concepts 30% longer than average
// - You forget concepts fastest on Sundays (stress day?)
// - Your optimal study session length is 45 minutes
// - You should review derivatives again in 4.2 days (not 7)
// - Consider switching to DENSE tracking for this concept"

### E. Legacy Compatibility Strategy

#### 1. Service Wrapper Pattern
```typescript
// Keep existing service interface but delegate to new implementation
export const generateDailyTasks = async (userId: number) => {
  // Use new enhanced service internally
  return await enhancedTodaysTasksService.generateTodaysTasksForUser(userId);
};

export const processReviewOutcome = async (
  userId: number, 
  primitiveId: string, 
  blueprintId: number, 
  isCorrect: boolean
) => {
  // Map primitiveId to criterionId and use new service
  const criterionId = await mapPrimitiveToCriterion(primitiveId, blueprintId);
  return await enhancedSrService.processReviewOutcome(userId, criterionId, isCorrect);
};
```

#### 2. Data Migration Utilities
```typescript
class LegacyDataMigrator {
  /**
   * Migrate existing UserPrimitiveProgress to new UserCriterionMastery
   */
  async migratePrimitiveProgress(): Promise<void> {
    const oldProgress = await prisma.userPrimitiveProgress.findMany();
    
    for (const progress of oldProgress) {
      const criterion = await findMasteryCriterion(progress.primitiveId, progress.blueprintId);
      
      if (criterion) {
        await prisma.userCriterionMastery.create({
          data: {
            userId: progress.userId,
            masteryCriterionId: criterion.id,
            blueprintSectionId: criterion.blueprintSectionId,
            // Map existing fields to new structure
            masteryScore: this.calculateLegacyMasteryScore(progress),
            currentIntervalStep: progress.reviewCount,
            nextReviewAt: progress.nextReviewAt,
            lastReviewedAt: progress.lastReviewedAt,
            reviewCount: progress.reviewCount,
            successfulReviews: progress.successfulReviews,
            trackingIntensity: progress.trackingIntensity
          }
        });
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Complete System Overview: Blueprint-Centric Learning Intelligence Platform
The Big Picture: What We're Building
We're creating a learning intelligence platform that transforms how people learn complex subjects. Think of it as upgrading from a simple study app to a personal learning coach that truly understands how you learn, what you know, and what you need to learn next.
This isn't just a spaced repetition system - it's a comprehensive learning ecosystem that adapts to each individual's learning style, goals, and progress.
The Core Philosophy: Mastery Through Understanding
The Fundamental Insight
Traditional learning systems track whether you've "studied" something. Our system tracks whether you've truly mastered it at multiple levels of understanding.
The Learning Pyramid:
UNDERSTAND: Basic comprehension (knowing what something is)
USE: Practical application (solving problems with it)
EXPLORE: Deep understanding (creating, analyzing, extending it)
You must prove mastery at each level before advancing to the next. This ensures real learning instead of just memorization.
How the System Works: The Complete Flow
1. Setting Up Your Learning Journey
Choose Your Learning Standards:
SURVEY (60%): Basic familiarity - "I want to know what this is about"
PROFICIENT (80%): Solid understanding - "I want to be able to use this"
EXPERT (95%): Deep mastery - "I want to truly understand this deeply"
Set Different Standards for Different Subjects:
Math: EXPERT level (95%) - because you love math and want deep understanding
History: PROFICIENT level (80%) - solid knowledge for conversations
Science: SURVEY level (60%) - basic awareness of concepts
The System Remembers Your Preferences:
Each blueprint section (like "Calculus Fundamentals" or "World War II") remembers your chosen mastery threshold and applies it consistently.
2. Daily Learning Experience
Morning Task Generation:
System analyzes what you need to review today
Categorizes by urgency: Critical (overdue), Core (due today), Plus (preview/advanced)
Respects your capacity: Fills buckets until your daily limit is reached
Provides feedback: Shows what couldn't fit and why
Offers solutions: Increase study time, reduce tracking intensity, or untrack sections
The Three Bucket System:
�� Critical Bucket: Urgent items - overdue by 3+ days or failed multiple times
🟡 Core Bucket: Important items - due today/tomorrow or new content
🟢 Plus Bucket: Nice to have - next stage previews, long-term reinforcement
Example Daily Experience:
3. The Mastery Achievement Process
To Master a Learning Criterion:
Get it right twice on different days (proves retention, not just cramming)
Meet your personal threshold (60%, 80%, or 95% based on your choice)
Demonstrate consistent performance across multiple question variations
Why Two Consecutive Successes?
First success: You understand when it's presented
Second success: You can recall and apply it later
Different days: Prevents temporary memorization, tests real learning
Example Mastery Journey:
4. UUE Stage Progression
Advancing Through Learning Levels:
UNDERSTAND Stage: Master basic concepts and definitions
USE Stage: Apply concepts to solve problems and exercises
EXPLORE Stage: Create, analyze, and extend concepts
Stage Mastery Requirements:
Weighted average of all criteria in that stage
Must meet your personal threshold (60%, 80%, or 95%)
All criteria must be mastered before advancing
Example Stage Progression:
5. Spaced Repetition with Progressive Failure Handling
The Interval Ladder:
Base intervals: [1, 3, 7, 21, 60, 180] days
Tracking intensity multipliers: DENSE (0.7×), NORMAL (1×), SPARSE (1.5×)
How It Works:
Success: Move up one step on the interval ladder
First failure: Go back one step (not all the way to start)
Second consecutive failure: Then go back to the beginning
Why Progressive Failure Handling?
More forgiving: One mistake doesn't destroy all progress
Encourages persistence: Users don't get discouraged easily
Realistic learning: Everyone has off days
Example with Different Tracking Intensities:
6. UUE Stage Progression in Daily Tasks
The Plus Bucket Magic:
Even if you haven't mastered the current stage, the system shows you preview questions from the next stage in the Plus bucket.
How It Works:
UNDERSTAND success: Plus bucket shows USE stage questions
USE success: Plus bucket shows EXPLORE stage questions
Not limited by strict stage progression: You can see what's coming next
Example Plus Bucket Content:
Why This Matters:
Maintains motivation: See progress toward next level
Prevents boredom: Always have challenging content available
Builds confidence: "I can handle this next level content!"
7. Infinite Question Generation
The "Generate More" Button:
Users can press this button infinitely to get more questions when they want additional practice or challenge.
What Happens When You Press "Generate More":
System analyzes your current progress and performance
Identifies appropriate content based on your UUE stage readiness
Provides questions that match your learning level
Adapts content based on what you're ready for
Smart Content Selection:
UUE progression previews: Next stage questions when you're ready
Long-term reinforcement: Previously mastered content not reviewed recently
Advanced content: Higher UUE stage material when appropriate
Variety: Different question types and difficulty levels
Example "Generate More" Experience:
The Data Collection Foundation
Rich Learning Analytics
Every Learning Interaction Captures:
Performance data: How well you did, when you studied
Temporal patterns: Time of day, day of week, session duration
Mastery progression: When you advance through UUE stages
Individual differences: Learning style, tracking intensity, subject difficulty
Context factors: Study environment, stress levels, learning goals
Example Data Point:
Why This Data is Revolutionary
Individual Learning Patterns:
Personal forgetting rates: How quickly does THIS user forget THIS concept?
Learning style effects: Do visual learners retain differently than kinesthetic?
Subject-specific patterns: Do they forget math faster than language?
Temporal Patterns:
Time of day effects: Do morning study sessions stick better?
Session duration: Do longer sessions lead to better retention?
Frequency patterns: Does studying daily vs. weekly affect forgetting?
Mastery Level Effects:
UNDERSTAND stage: How quickly do basic concepts fade?
USE stage: Do applied concepts stick longer?
EXPLORE stage: Does deep understanding resist forgetting better?
Future Intelligence: Forgetting Curves and Adaptive Learning
Phase 1: Data Collection (Current Sprint)
✅ Collect all the data we need
✅ Build the infrastructure for analysis
Phase 2: ML Model Training (Future Sprint)
Phase 3: Adaptive Intervals (Future Sprint)
The Future Learning Experience
Personalized Learning Intelligence:
Legacy Compatibility: Smooth Transition
Why We're Not Breaking Existing Users
The Challenge: We're completely redesigning the system, but existing users depend on it working exactly as before.
Our Solution: Legacy compatibility layer that keeps the old system working while we build the new one.
How Legacy Compatibility Works
Service Wrapper Pattern:
Data Migration Utilities:
Migration Strategy
Phase 1: Parallel Implementation
Keep existing services functional
Create new enhanced services
Test with subset of users
Phase 2: Gradual Migration
Route some users to new system
Compare task generation quality
Optimize based on real usage
Phase 3: Full Migration
Switch all users to new system
Deprecate old services
Remove legacy code
