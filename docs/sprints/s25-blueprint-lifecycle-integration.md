# Sprint 25: Blueprint Lifecycle Integration

**Signed off** Antonio
**Date Range:** TBD - TBD
**Primary Focus:** Core API - Blueprint CRUD Operations with AI API Synchronization
**Overview:** Implement complete blueprint lifecycle management with AI API synchronization, including creation indexing, update synchronization, and deletion cleanup in the vector database.

## I. Planned Tasks & To-Do List (Derived from Gemini's Prompt)

*Instructions for Antonio: Review the prompt/instructions provided by Gemini for the current development task. Break down each distinct step or deliverable into a checkable to-do item below. Be specific.*

- [ ] **Task 1:** Enhance AiRAGService with Blueprint Indexing
    - *Sub-task 1.1:* Add blueprint indexing call after creation (integrate with existing createLearningBlueprint)
    - *Sub-task 1.2:* Implement error handling for indexing failures (non-blocking approach)
    - *Sub-task 1.3:* Add logging and monitoring for indexing operations
- [ ] **Task 2:** Implement Blueprint Update Operations
    - *Sub-task 2.1:* Create updateLearningBlueprint method in AiRAGService
    - *Sub-task 2.2:* Add AI API sync for blueprint updates (incremental vs full reindex)
    - *Sub-task 2.3:* Implement change preview functionality (dry run)
    - *Sub-task 2.4:* Add PUT endpoint in learning-blueprints.controller.ts
- [ ] **Task 3:** Implement Blueprint Deletion Operations
    - *Sub-task 3.1:* Enhance deleteLearningBlueprint method in AiRAGService
    - *Sub-task 3.2:* Add AI API cleanup call for deleted blueprints
    - *Sub-task 3.3:* Add proper cascade deletion handling
    - *Sub-task 3.4:* Add DELETE endpoint in learning-blueprints.controller.ts
- [ ] **Task 4:** Add Blueprint Status Management
    - *Sub-task 4.1:* Implement blueprint indexing status checking
    - *Sub-task 4.2:* Add reindexing capability for failed indexing operations
    - *Sub-task 4.3:* Create status endpoint for blueprint synchronization state
- [ ] **Task 5:** Update Learning Blueprints Controller
    - *Sub-task 5.1:* Add missing CRUD endpoints (GET, PUT, DELETE)
    - *Sub-task 5.2:* Integrate AI API client throughout all operations
    - *Sub-task 5.3:* Add proper error handling and user feedback
    - *Sub-task 5.4:* Update route definitions in learning-blueprints routes
- [ ] **Task 6:** Create Integration Tests
    - *Sub-task 6.1:* Test blueprint creation with AI API indexing
    - *Sub-task 6.2:* Test blueprint update synchronization
    - *Sub-task 6.3:* Test blueprint deletion cleanup
    - *Sub-task 6.4:* Test error scenarios and resilience
