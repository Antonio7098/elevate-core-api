**Signed off** Antonio
**Date Range:** [Start Date] - [End Date]
**Primary Focus:** Core api
**Overview:** Create Recursive Endpoints for Aggregate Views

---

## I. Planned Tasks & To-Do List

- [x] **Task 1: Backend - Create Recursive Endpoints for Aggregate Views**
    - [x] **Sub-task 1.1:** In the Core API, create a new endpoint: `GET /api/folders/:folderId/all-questions`.
        * The service logic for this endpoint must traverse the entire folder sub-tree starting from the given `folderId`, find all `QuestionSet`s within that tree, collect all their `Question`s, group them by their parent `QuestionSet` and `Folder`, and return them in a structured list.
    - [x] **Sub-task 1.2:** Create a similar new endpoint: `GET /api/folders/:folderId/all-notes`.
        * This endpoint will recursively find and return all `Note`s within the folder tree, grouped by their parent `Folder` or `QuestionSet`.
    - [x] **Sub-task 1.3:** Write integration tests for these two new recursive endpoints to ensure they correctly aggregate data from nested structures.

## II. Agent's Implementation Summary & Notes

**Regarding Task 1: Backend - Create Recursive Endpoints for Aggregate Views**
* **Summary of Implementation:**
    * Created a new service module `recursiveFolder.service.ts` with two main functions:
        - `getAllQuestionsInFolderTree`: Recursively traverses folder tree to collect all questions
        - `getAllNotesInFolderTree`: Recursively traverses folder tree to collect all notes
    * Implemented proper error handling and user ownership verification
    * Added type safety with TypeScript interfaces for response structures
    * Ensured efficient database queries with proper Prisma relations
* **Key Files Modified/Created:**
    * `src/services/recursiveFolder.service.ts`
    * `src/controllers/recursiveFolder.controller.ts`
    * `src/routes/folder.routes.ts`
    * `src/routes/folder.routes.test.ts`
* **Notes/Challenges Encountered:**
    * Implemented proper type handling for Prisma responses
    * Added null safety for optional fields
    * Ensured proper cleanup in test cases

## III. Overall Sprint Summary & Review

**1. Key Accomplishments this Sprint:**
    * Successfully implemented recursive folder traversal for both questions and notes
    * Created type-safe interfaces for response structures
    * Added comprehensive test coverage for all new endpoints
    * Implemented proper error handling and authentication checks

**2. Deviations from Original Plan/Prompt:**
    * None - all planned tasks were completed as specified

**3. New Issues, Bugs, or Challenges Encountered:**
    * Had to handle type safety for Prisma responses
    * Needed to ensure proper null handling for optional fields
    * Required careful test data cleanup to prevent test pollution

**4. Key Learnings & Decisions Made:**
    * Implemented efficient recursive traversal using async/await
    * Used TypeScript interfaces for better type safety
    * Structured response data to maintain folder hierarchy

**5. Blockers (if any):**
    * None - all tasks completed successfully

**6. Next Steps Considered / Plan for Next Sprint:**
    * Consider adding pagination for large folder trees
    * Add caching for frequently accessed folder trees
    * Implement filtering options for questions and notes

**Sprint Status:** Fully Completed
