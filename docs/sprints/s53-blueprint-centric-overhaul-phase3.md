# Sprint 52: Blueprint-Centric Overhaul - Phase 3 Frontend Transformation

**Signed off** DO NOT PROCEED UNLESS SIGNED OFF BY ANTONIO
**Date Range:** [Start Date] - [End Date]
**Primary Focus:** Frontend UI/UX Transformation & User Experience
**Overview:** Transform the frontend from folder-based navigation to blueprint section navigation. This sprint creates the new user interface that makes blueprint sections feel like intuitive folders while providing advanced knowledge graph capabilities.

## I. Sprint Goals & Objectives

### Primary Goals:
1. **Blueprint Navigation UI**: Replace folder navigation with blueprint section navigation
2. **Section-Based Content View**: Show notes and questions organized by blueprint sections
3. **Knowledge Graph Visualization**: Interactive visualization of concept relationships
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple interface by default, advanced features on demand

### Secondary Goals:
1. **Study Session Interface**: Create blueprint section-based study sessions
2. **Learning Path Visualization**: Show optimal learning sequences
3. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensure blueprint navigation works on all devices
4. **Accessibility**: Make the new interface accessible to all users

## II. Technical Architecture

### A. Component Architecture
```typescript
// Main Navigation Component
interface BlueprintNavigationProps {
  blueprintId: string;
  currentSectionId?: string;
  onSectionSelect: (sectionId: string) => void;
  showAdvancedFeatures?: boolean;
}

// Section Tree Component
interface SectionTreeProps {
  sections: BlueprintSection[];
  selectedSectionId?: string;
  expandedSections: Set<string>;
  onSectionToggle: (sectionId: string) => void;
  onSectionSelect: (sectionId: string) => void;
}

// Content View Component
interface SectionContentViewProps {
  section: BlueprintSection;
  notes: NoteSection[];
  questions: QuestionInstance[];
  onNoteEdit: (noteId: string) => void;
  onQuestionAnswer: (questionId: string, answer: string) => void;
}
```

### B. State Management
```typescript
// Blueprint Navigation State
interface BlueprintNavigationState {
  currentBlueprint: LearningBlueprint | null;
  selectedSectionId: string | null;
  expandedSections: Set<string>;
  showAdvancedFeatures: boolean;
  searchQuery: string;
  filterOptions: FilterOptions;
}

// Content State
interface ContentState {
  notes: Record<string, NoteSection[]>;
  questions: Record<string, QuestionInstance[]>;
  userProgress: Record<string, UserProgress>;
  loadingStates: Record<string, boolean>;
}
```
