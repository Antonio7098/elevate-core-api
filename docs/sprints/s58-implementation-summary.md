**Date:** August 17, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Sprint:** S58 - Multi-Primitive Mastery Criteria Implementation

---

## 🎯 Sprint Goals Achieved

### ✅ Primary Goals Completed:
1. **Database Schema Updates** - New junction table and enhanced MasteryCriterion model
2. **Service Layer Updates** - Enhanced MasteryCriterionService and new BlueprintCentricService
3. **API Endpoint Updates** - New multi-primitive endpoints with proper routing
4. **Comprehensive Testing** - Unit tests for all new functionality

## 🗄️ Database Schema Changes

### New Junction Table: `MasteryCriterionPrimitive`
```sql
CREATE TABLE "MasteryCriterionPrimitive" (
  "id" SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  "criterionId" INTEGER NOT NULL,
  "primitiveId" TEXT NOT NULL,
  "relationshipType" "PrimitiveRelationshipType" NOT NULL DEFAULT 'PRIMARY',
  "weight" FLOAT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1.0,
  "strength" FLOAT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0.8,
  "createdAt" TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  "updatedAt" TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL,
  
  FOREIGN KEY ("criterionId") REFERENCES "MasteryCriterion"("id") ON DELETE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY ("primitiveId") REFERENCES "KnowledgePrimitive"("primitiveId") ON DELETE CASCADE,
  
  UNIQUE("criterionId", "primitiveId")
);
```

### Enhanced `MasteryCriterion` Table
- Added `estimatedPrimitiveCount` (INTEGER, default: 1)
- Added `relationshipComplexity` (FLOAT, default: 1.0)
- Added `maxPrimitives` (INTEGER, default: 10)
- Added relationship to `MasteryCriterionPrimitive[]`

### New Enums
- `PrimitiveRelationshipType`: PRIMARY, SECONDARY, CONTEXTUAL
- `RelationshipStrength`: WEAK, MODERATE, STRONG

---

## 🔧 Service Layer Implementation

### Enhanced `MasteryCriterionService`
**New Multi-Primitive Methods:**
- `createMultiPrimitiveCriterion()` - Creates criteria with multiple primitives
- `linkPrimitiveToCriterion()` - Links a primitive to an existing criterion
- `unlinkPrimitiveFromCriterion()` - Removes primitive relationship
- `getCriterionWithPrimitives()` - Gets criterion with all linked primitives
- `updatePrimitiveRelationships()` - Bulk updates primitive relationships
- `validateMultiPrimitiveCriterion()` - Validates multi-primitive criteria

**Key Features:**
- UUE stage complexity validation (UNDERSTAND: 1-2, USE: 2-4, EXPLORE: 4+)
- Relationship weight and strength management
- Maximum primitive limits enforcement
- Automatic complexity scoring

### New `BlueprintCentricService`
**Core Methods:**
- `validatePrimitiveRelationships()` - Validates primitive relationships
- `calculateUueStageComplexity()` - Calculates appropriate UUE stage
- `buildPrimitiveDependencyMap()` - Maps primitive dependencies
- `analyzeBlueprintSection()` - Analyzes section for optimal criteria distribution
- `suggestPrimitiveGroupings()` - Suggests optimal primitive groupings

**STUB Implementation:**
- `generateMultiPrimitiveCriteria()` - AI-powered generation (stub for future sprint)

## 🌐 API Endpoints

### New Multi-Primitive Endpoints
```
POST   /api/criterion/:id/primitives                    # Link primitive to criterion
DELETE /api/criterion/:id/primitives/:primitiveId       # Unlink primitive from criterion
PUT    /api/criterion/:id/primitives/:primitiveId       # Update primitive relationship
GET    /api/criterion/:id/primitives                    # Get criterion primitives
GET    /api/criterion/:id/relationships                 # Get criterion relationships
POST   /api/criterion/validate                          # Validate multi-primitive criterion
POST   /api/criterion/generate-multi-primitive          # STUB: AI generation
```

### Enhanced Existing Endpoints
- All existing mastery criterion endpoints remain functional
- Backward compatibility maintained for single-primitive criteria
- New multi-primitive data structures integrated seamlessly
