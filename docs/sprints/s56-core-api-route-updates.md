router.get('/uue-stage-progress/:criterionId', enhancedSpacedRepetitionController.getUueStageProgress);
router.post('/mastery-threshold', enhancedSpacedRepetitionController.updateMasteryThreshold);
router.get('/mastery-thresholds/:sectionId', enhancedSpacedRepetitionController.getMasteryThresholds);
router.put('/tracking-intensity', enhancedSpacedRepetitionController.updateTrackingIntensity);
```

router.get('/next-stage-preview/:sectionId', enhancedTodaysTasksController.getNextStagePreview);
router.post('/generate-more', enhancedTodaysTasksController.generateMoreTasks);
```

### B. Route Organization Strategy

#### 1. Backward Compatibility
