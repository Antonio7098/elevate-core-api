Sprint ##: Backend Enhancements - Nested Folders, Notes & Model Updates
Date Range: [Start Date] - [End Date]
Primary Focus: Core API - Database Schema Evolution & New Feature Logic
Overview: This sprint focuses on implementing significant backend features. The primary goals are to refactor the database schema to support nested folders, add a new Note model with full CRUD functionality, and enhance the Question and QuestionSet models with new attributes to support more advanced application logic.

I. Planned Tasks & To-Do List
Instructions for the agent: The first phase is to update the Prisma schema comprehensively. Once the schema is migrated, implement the corresponding API logic, starting with the highest priority feature (Nested Folders).

[X] Task 1: Update Prisma Schema (schema.prisma)

[x] Sub-task 1.1 (Question Model): Modify the Question model:

Remove isCorrect: Boolean?.

Add selfMark: Boolean @default(false).

Add autoMark: Boolean @default(false).

Add aiGenerated: Boolean @default(false).

Add inCat: String?.

[X] Sub-task 1.2 (QuestionSet Model): Modify the QuestionSet model:

Add source: String? (to store original source material).

Add notes: String[] (for simple text notes/links).

Add instructions: String? (for AI generation guidance).

Add isTracked: Boolean @default(true) (to toggle SR tracking).

[X] Sub-task 1.3 (Folder Model - Nested Folders): Implement a self-referencing relationship:

Add parentId: Int?.

Add parent: Folder? @relation("FolderHierarchy", fields: [parentId], references: [id], onDelete: SetNull).

Add children: Folder[] @relation("FolderHierarchy").

[X] Sub-task 1.4 (New Note Model): Create the Note model for rich text content:

Fields: id, title: String, content: Json, plainText: String?.

Relations: Link to User (required), Folder? (optional), and QuestionSet? (optional). Use onDelete: SetNull for Folder/QuestionSet relations.

[X] Sub-task 1.5 (Inverse Relations): Add the inverse relation notes: Note[] to the User, Folder, and QuestionSet models.

[X] Task 2: Apply Schema Changes & Regenerate Client

[X] Sub-task 2.1: After all schema changes are saved, run the migration: npx prisma migrate dev --name "feature_notes_nesting_and_model_updates"

[X] Sub-task 2.2: Ensure the Prisma Client is successfully regenerated to reflect all changes (npx prisma generate).

[X] Task 3: Implement Backend Logic & Endpoints (in order of priority)

[X] Sub-task 3.1 (Nested Folders - Highest Priority):

Service (folder.service.ts): Modify createFolder to accept an optional parentId. Refactor getFolders to fetch all user folders and then programmatically assemble them into a nested tree structure before returning. Modify updateFolder to handle moving folders and prevent logical errors (e.g., a folder becoming its own parent).

Controller (folder.controller.ts): Update request/response formats to handle the new hierarchical structure.

[X] Sub-task 3.2 (Notes CRUD - Self-Contained Task):

Create new files: note.routes.ts, note.controller.ts, note.service.ts.

Implement the full set of CRUD endpoints for Notes (Create, Read for a folder/set, Update, Delete), ensuring all operations verify user ownership.

[X] Sub-task 3.3 (Integrate New Fields into Existing Logic):

Review existing services (aiService.ts, spacedRepetition.service.ts, questionSetService.ts).

When creating questions via AI, set the aiGenerated: true flag.

The AI generation service should now use the new instructions field from the QuestionSet model to enhance its prompts if the field is present.

The answer evaluation flow must now consider the selfMark and autoMark flags on a Question to decide whether to call the AI for evaluation or to perform a simple automatic check.

[X] Task 4: Update Integration Tests

[X] Sub-task 4.1: Heavily refactor tests in folder.routes.test.ts to assert on the new nested/hierarchical data structure for GET /folders and to test folder creation/updates with a parentId.

[X] Sub-task 4.2: Create a new test file, note.routes.test.ts, with comprehensive tests for all new Notes CRUD endpoints.

[X] Sub-task 4.3: Add/update tests for the AI generation and evaluation flows to verify the logic related to the new boolean flags (aiGenerated, selfMark, autoMark) and the use of the instructions field.

- **Coverage:**
  - Full CRUD lifecycle for notes:
    - `POST /api/notes` (create)
    - `GET /api/notes` (list, with filtering by `folderId` and `questionSetId`)
    - `GET /api/notes/:id` (retrieve single note)
    - `PUT /api/notes/:id` (update)
    - `DELETE /api/notes/:id` (delete)
  - Verified notes can be associated with either a folder or a question set.

V. Frontend Integration Guide for Nested Folders

This section provides instructions for the frontend on how to use the new nested folders structure.

### API Endpoints

- **GET /api/folders**
  - **Description:** Retrieves all folders for the authenticated user, returned as a nested tree structure.
  - **Response Format:**
    ```json
    [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Root Folder",
        "parentId": null,
        "children": [
          {
            "id": 2,
            "name": "Child Folder",
            "parentId": 1,
            "children": []
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
    ```
  - **Usage:** Use this endpoint to display the folder hierarchy in the UI.

- **POST /api/folders**
  - **Description:** Creates a new folder. Optionally, specify a `parentId` to create a nested folder.
  - **Request Body:**
    ```json
    {
      "name": "New Folder",
      "parentId": 1  // Optional; omit to create a root folder
    }
    ```
  - **Response:** Returns the created folder object.

- **PUT /api/folders/:id**
  - **Description:** Updates a folder, including moving it to a new parent.
  - **Request Body:**
    ```json
    {
      "name": "Updated Folder",
      "parentId": 2  // Optional; omit to keep the current parent
    }
    ```
  - **Response:** Returns the updated folder object.

- **DELETE /api/folders/:id**
  - **Description:** Deletes a folder. If the folder has children, they will be orphaned (parentId set to null).

### Frontend Implementation Tips

1. **Displaying the Folder Tree:**
   - Use a recursive component to render the nested folder structure.
   - Example (pseudo-code):
     ```jsx
     function FolderTree({ folders }) {
       return (
         <ul>
           {folders.map(folder => (
             <li key={folder.id}>
               {folder.name}
               {folder.children.length > 0 && <FolderTree folders={folder.children} />}
             </li>
           ))}
         </ul>
       );
     }
     ```

2. **Creating Nested Folders:**
   - When creating a folder, include the `parentId` in the request body to nest it under another folder.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     const createFolder = async (name, parentId) => {
       const response = await fetch('/api/folders', {
         method: 'POST',
         headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
         body: JSON.stringify({ name, parentId })
       });
       return response.json();
     };
     ```

3. **Moving Folders:**
   - Use the `PUT /api/folders/:id` endpoint to update a folder's `parentId` and move it within the hierarchy.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     const moveFolder = async (folderId, newParentId) => {
       const response = await fetch(`/api/folders/${folderId}`, {
         method: 'PUT',
         headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
         body: JSON.stringify({ parentId: newParentId })
       });
       return response.json();
     };
     ```

4. **Handling Orphaned Folders:**
   - If a folder is deleted, its children become orphaned. Ensure the UI handles this gracefully, possibly by prompting the user to reassign or delete orphaned folders.

### Example Workflow

1. Fetch the folder tree using `GET /api/folders`.
2. Display the folder hierarchy using a recursive component.
3. Allow users to create new folders, specifying a `parentId` to nest them.
4. Enable moving folders by updating their `parentId` via `PUT /api/folders/:id`.
5. Handle folder deletion, ensuring orphaned folders are managed appropriately.

By following these guidelines, the frontend can effectively utilize the new nested folders structure, providing a seamless user experience for managing folder hierarchies.
