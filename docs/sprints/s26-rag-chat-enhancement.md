# Sprint 26: RAG Chat Enhancement & Pipeline Integration

**Signed off** Antonio
**Date Range:** TBD - TBD
**Primary Focus:** Core API - RAG Pipeline Enhancement & Chat Integration
**Overview:** Enhance the chat service with proper RAG retrieval capabilities, implement user memory context fetching, and establish comprehensive testing and monitoring for the complete Core API ↔ AI API integration.

## I. Planned Tasks & To-Do List (Derived from Gemini's Prompt)

*Instructions for Antonio: Review the prompt/instructions provided by Gemini for the current development task. Break down each distinct step or deliverable into a checkable to-do item below. Be specific.*

- [ ] **Task 1:** Enhance Chat Service with RAG Integration
    - *Sub-task 1.1:* Update handleChatMessage to use blueprint indexing for context retrieval
    - *Sub-task 1.2:* Implement user memory context fetching from database
    - *Sub-task 1.3:* Add proper context filtering and relevance scoring
    - *Sub-task 1.4:* Enhance chat history management and persistence
- [ ] **Task 2:** Implement User Memory Integration
    - *Sub-task 2.1:* Create service for fetching UserMemory based on context
    - *Sub-task 2.2:* Add memory context to chat requests sent to AI API
    - *Sub-task 2.3:* Implement memory relevance filtering for chat context
    - *Sub-task 2.4:* Add memory persistence for chat sessions
- [ ] **Task 3:** Add RAG Pipeline Status & Monitoring
    - *Sub-task 3.1:* Create health check endpoints for RAG pipeline status
    - *Sub-task 3.2:* Implement indexing status monitoring and alerting
    - *Sub-task 3.3:* Add performance metrics for chat response times
    - *Sub-task 3.4:* Create debugging endpoints for RAG retrieval testing
- [ ] **Task 4:** Implement Comprehensive Error Handling
    - *Sub-task 4.1:* Add graceful degradation when AI API is unavailable
    - *Sub-task 4.2:* Implement fallback mechanisms for chat without RAG
    - *Sub-task 4.3:* Add proper error logging and monitoring
    - *Sub-task 4.4:* Create user-friendly error messages for frontend
- [ ] **Task 5:** Create Integration Testing Suite
    - *Sub-task 5.1:* Test end-to-end blueprint creation → indexing → chat retrieval
    - *Sub-task 5.2:* Test blueprint update → reindexing → updated chat context
    - *Sub-task 5.3:* Test blueprint deletion → cleanup → chat context removal
    - *Sub-task 5.4:* Test AI API failure scenarios and recovery
- [ ] **Task 6:** Documentation & Developer Experience
    - *Sub-task 6.1:* Update API documentation with new RAG endpoints
    - *Sub-task 6.2:* Create developer guide for RAG integration testing
    - *Sub-task 6.3:* Add environment setup documentation
    - *Sub-task 6.4:* Create troubleshooting guide for AI API connectivity issues
