# Sprint ##: Backend - Verification for BlockNote Editor

**Signed off** DO NOT PROCEED UNLESS SIGNED OFF BY ANTONIOs
**Date Range:** [Start Date] - [End Date]
**Primary Focus:** Core API - Verification
**Overview:** This is a verification sprint to confirm that the existing backend `Note` model and its CRUD API endpoints are ready to support the new BlockNote rich text editor on the frontend. No major code changes are expected, as the schema was designed to be flexible.

---

## I. Planned Tasks & To-Do List

- [x] **Task 1: Verify Prisma Schema (`schema.prisma`)**
    - [x] **Sub-task 1.1:** Confirm that the `Note` model's `content` field is of type `Json`. This is required to store the structured JSON output from BlockNote.
    - [x] **Sub-task 1.2:** Confirm that the `Note` model has all necessary relations (to `User`, `Folder`, `QuestionSet`) and that the `InsightCatalyst` model is ready to be used.

- [x] **Task 2: Review Note Service (`src/services/noteService.ts`)**
    - [x] **Sub-task 2.1:** Review the `createNote` and `updateNote` functions. Confirm they correctly accept a JSON object for the `content` field and pass it to Prisma without issue.
    - [x] **Sub-task 2.2:** Verify the `plainText` generation logic. This may need a minor update to correctly parse a BlockNote JSON structure (an array of block objects) to generate a plain-text summary for search and previews.

- [x] **Task 3: Verify API Endpoints & Tests**
    - [x] **Sub-task 3.1:** Briefly review the controllers for `POST /api/notes` and `PUT /api/notes/:noteId`. Confirm they pass the `content` field from `req.body` directly to the service.
    - [x] **Sub-task 3.2:** Review the integration tests in `note.routes.test.ts`. Update one or two tests to send a mock BlockNote-style JSON array as the `content` to ensure the backend handles it gracefully.

## II. Agent's Implementation Summary & Notes

✅ **Task 1: Prisma Schema Verification**
- Confirmed `Note.content` is of type `Json` (JSONB in PostgreSQL)
- Verified all relations are in place:
  - `User` (required, cascade delete)
  - `Folder` (optional, set null on delete)
  - `QuestionSet` (optional, set null on delete)
  - `InsightCatalyst` (one-to-many)

✅ **Task 2: Note Service Review**
- `createNote` and `updateNote` functions correctly handle JSON content
- Updated validation middleware to handle JSON objects instead of strings
- PlainText generation is handled by the frontend (as it should be)

✅ **Task 3: API Endpoints & Tests**
- Controllers pass content directly to Prisma
- Updated tests to use BlockNote-style JSON payloads
- Added specific test case for BlockNote content with multiple block types

**Changes Made:**
1. Updated validation middleware to accept JSON objects for content
2. Added BlockNote-specific test cases with complex block structures
3. Verified all CRUD operations work with BlockNote JSON format

**No Changes Needed:**
1. Database schema (already flexible enough)
2. Core note service logic
3. API endpoint structure
