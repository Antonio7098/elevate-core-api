# Sprint ##: Backend - Refine UserMemory Schema

**Date Range:** [Start Date] - [End Date]
**Primary Focus:** Core API - Aligning `UserMemory` Schema with Diagnostic Test Requirements
**Overview:** This sprint is a refactor of the backend `UserMemory` feature. The goal is to replace the initial placeholder enums and fields in the Prisma schema with the new, more specific ones derived from the cognitive learning preference research. This will ensure the backend can correctly store and utilize the results from the user's diagnostic test.

## I. Planned Tasks & To-Do List

*Instructions for the agent: This sprint involves a destructive schema change (renaming enums and fields). Follow the steps carefully.*

- [x] **Task 1: Refactor Prisma Schema (`schema.prisma`)**
    - [x] **Sub-task 1.1 (Remove Old Enums):** In your schema file, completely **delete** the following old enum definitions:
        * `enum LearningStyle { ... }`
        * `enum AiTone { ... }`
        * `enum AiVerbosity { ... }`
    - [x] **Sub-task 1.2 (Add New, Correct Enums):** Add the new enum definitions required by the diagnostic test:
        * `CognitiveApproach`, `ExplanationStyle`, `InteractionStyle` (see schema)
    - [x] **Sub-task 1.3 (Update `UserMemory` Model):** Modify the `UserMemory` model to use these new enums and field names. The final model now matches the MVP requirements.

- [x] **Task 2: Apply Schema Changes**
    - [x] **Sub-task 2.1:** Migration created and applied: `npx prisma migrate dev --name "refactor_usermemory_enums_and_fields"`
    - [x] **Sub-task 2.2:** Prisma Client regenerated with new types (`npx prisma generate`).

- [x] **Task 3: Update Backend Services and Controllers**
    - [x] **Sub-task 3.1:** Update `userMemory.service.ts` to use new field names and enums.
    - [x] **Sub-task 3.2:** Update `aiService.ts` to fetch and pass new user memory fields.
    - [x] **Sub-task 3.3:** Update `userMemory.controller.ts` for new types and validation.

- [x] **Task 4: Update Integration Tests (`userMemory.routes.test.ts`)**
    - [x] **Sub-task 4.1:** Refactor all tests for the `/api/user/memory` endpoints.
    - [x] **Sub-task 4.2:** The test payloads for `PUT` requests must now use the new structure (e.g., `{ "cognitiveApproach": "TOP_DOWN", ... }`).
    - [x] **Sub-task 4.3:** All test assertions must check for the new field names and enum values in the response data.

## II. Agent's Implementation Summary & Notes

- Prisma schema updated: Old enums removed, new enums and fields added for UserMemory.
- Migration applied and Prisma Client regenerated.
- Service layer (`userMemory.service.ts`), AI service, and controller now use the new enums and fields.
- Integration tests refactored for new structure and field names.
- System is now fully aligned with the diagnostic test requirements for user preferences.
