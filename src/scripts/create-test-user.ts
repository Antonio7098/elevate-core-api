      generatedFromBlueprintId: newtonBlueprint.id,
      title: 'Newton\'s Laws: Real-World Applications',
      content: `## Newton's Laws in Everyday Life

### First Law (Inertia)
- **Car Safety**: Seatbelts prevent passengers from continuing forward motion when the car stops
- **Space Travel**: Objects in space continue moving until acted upon by forces
- **Sports**: A soccer ball stays in motion until friction or air resistance slows it

### Second Law (F=ma)
- **Rocket Launch**: More fuel (mass) requires more thrust (force) for the same acceleration
- **Car Performance**: Lighter cars accelerate faster with the same engine power
- **Sports Equipment**: Heavier bats require more force to swing at the same speed

### Third Law (Action-Reaction)
- **Walking**: Your foot pushes backward on the ground, the ground pushes you forward
- **Swimming**: You push water backward, water pushes you forward
- **Rocket Propulsion**: Gas expelled backward pushes rocket forward

### Key Formulas
- Force = mass √ó acceleration (F = ma)
- Weight = mass √ó gravity (W = mg)
- Momentum = mass √ó velocity (p = mv)

### Common Misconceptions
- Objects don't "run out of force" - they're acted upon by opposing forces
- Heavier objects don't fall faster (in vacuum)
- Action-reaction pairs act on different objects`,

  // Note 2: Energy Conservation

      folderId: physicsFolder.id,
      generatedFromBlueprintId: energyBlueprint.id,
      title: 'Energy Transformations and Conservation',
      content: `## Energy Conservation in Systems

### Types of Energy
1. **Kinetic Energy (KE)**: Energy of motion
   - Formula: KE = 1/2 √ó mass √ó velocity¬≤
   - Units: Joules (J)

2. **Potential Energy (PE)**: Stored energy
   - Gravitational PE = mass √ó gravity √ó height
   - Elastic PE = 1/2 √ó spring constant √ó displacement¬≤

### Energy Conservation Examples

#### Pendulum Motion
- At highest point: Maximum PE, minimum KE
- At lowest point: Maximum KE, minimum PE
- Total mechanical energy remains constant

#### Roller Coaster
- Top of hill: High PE, low KE
- Bottom of hill: High KE, low PE
- Friction converts some energy to heat

#### Bouncing Ball
- Each bounce loses some energy to air resistance
- Eventually stops due to energy dissipation

### Real-World Applications
- **Hydroelectric Power**: Converts gravitational PE to electrical energy
- **Wind Turbines**: Convert kinetic energy of air to electrical energy
- **Solar Panels**: Convert light energy to electrical energy

### Energy Efficiency
- No system is 100% efficient
- Some energy always converts to heat
- Efficiency = useful energy output / total energy input`,

      title: 'Chemical Bonding: Types and Properties',
      content: `## Understanding Chemical Bonds

### Ionic Bonds
**Formation**: Electron transfer between metal and nonmetal
**Properties**:
- High melting and boiling points
- Conduct electricity when dissolved or molten
- Brittle crystalline structure
- Soluble in water

**Examples**: NaCl (table salt), CaO (lime)

### Covalent Bonds
**Formation**: Electron sharing between nonmetals
**Properties**:
- Lower melting points than ionic compounds
- Poor electrical conductivity
- Can be gases, liquids, or solids
- Variable solubility

**Examples**: H‚ÇÇO (water), CO‚ÇÇ (carbon dioxide)

### Metallic Bonds
**Formation**: Delocalized electrons shared among metal atoms
**Properties**:
- Excellent electrical conductivity
- Malleable and ductile
- High thermal conductivity
- Metallic luster

**Examples**: Copper, iron, aluminum

### Bond Strength Factors
1. **Electronegativity Difference**: Greater difference = more ionic character
2. **Atomic Size**: Smaller atoms form stronger bonds
3. **Number of Bonds**: Multiple bonds are stronger than single bonds

### Predicting Bond Type
- **Ionic**: Electronegativity difference > 1.7
- **Polar Covalent**: Electronegativity difference 0.4-1.7
- **Nonpolar Covalent**: Electronegativity difference < 0.4`,

      content: `## Understanding Calculus

### What is Calculus?
Calculus is the mathematical study of continuous change. It has two main branches:
- **Differential Calculus**: Studies rates of change
- **Integral Calculus**: Studies accumulation

### Derivatives (Rates of Change)

**Definition**: The derivative measures how fast a function changes
**Notation**: f'(x) or dy/dx

**Common Derivatives**:
- Power Rule: d/dx(x‚Åø) = nx‚Åø‚Åª¬π
- Constant Rule: d/dx(c) = 0
- Sum Rule: d/dx(f + g) = f' + g'
- Chain Rule: d/dx(f(g(x))) = f'(g(x)) √ó g'(x)

**Applications**:
- Velocity is the derivative of position
- Acceleration is the derivative of velocity
- Marginal cost is the derivative of total cost

### Integrals (Accumulation)

**Definition**: The integral measures accumulation over an interval
**Notation**: ‚à´f(x)dx

**Types**:
- **Indefinite Integral**: ‚à´f(x)dx = F(x) + C
- **Definite Integral**: ‚à´‚Çê·µáf(x)dx = F(b) - F(a)

**Applications**:
- Area under a curve
- Distance traveled (integral of velocity)
- Total cost (integral of marginal cost)

### Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
Connects derivatives and integrals:
‚à´‚Çê·µáf'(x)dx = f(b) - f(a)

### Real-World Applications
- **Physics**: Motion, forces, energy
- **Economics**: Marginal analysis, optimization
- **Engineering**: Design, optimization
- **Biology**: Population growth, drug concentration`,
