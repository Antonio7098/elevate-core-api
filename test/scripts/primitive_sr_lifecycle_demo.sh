# Elevate Core API - Primitive Spaced Repetition Lifecycle Demo
# ==============================================================================
#
# This script demonstrates the full lifecycle of a user interacting with the
# primitive-based spaced repetition system. It makes live API calls to a
# running instance of the application.
#
# Prerequisites:
# 1. The Elevate Core API server must be running.
# 2. `jq` must be installed for pretty-printing JSON: `sudo apt-get install jq`
# 3. A test user and associated primitive data must be seeded. The script
#    assumes the data from `primitive-lifecycle.e2e.test.ts` exists.

# --- Configuration ---
BASE_URL="http://localhost:3000/api"
# Special test token that bypasses JWT verification in test environments
AUTH_TOKEN="test1234"
# The test user ID to use for all requests
USER_ID="1"
# The ID of the primitive we will be testing with
# This should match the primitive seeded in the e2e test (e.g., 'React Hooks')
PRIMITIVE_ID="primitive-e2e-1"

# --- Helper Function ---
# Function to make and print API calls

  local description=$4
